## ENPH 253 Robot Software

I've set up a repository for coding our robot in PlatformIO. This will allow us to better structure the software portion of the robot. PlatformIO is basically better than the Arduino IDE in every possible way. 

To install PlatformIO, download the PlatformIO IDE for VSCode at [this page](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html). Then follow the instructions (originally shared by Vlad Pomogaev) that I've rehosted in this repository.
